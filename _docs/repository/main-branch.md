# Main Branch
The main branch provided based on service url (*API Service*). There are:

 1. master (*for production*)
 2. staging (*for uat*)
 3. development (*for development*)


### Master
Production environment is an environment where the application is completely ready for use by end-users so that this environment must be guaranteed so that there are no major bugs that can cause large unwanted problems.

### Staging 
The staging environment is an environment where QA and the product owner will try out the application before it is released to end-users

### Development 
The development environment is an environment where application developers will experiment with applications that have been made before being tested by QA and end users. This way, developers can prevent bugs before the app is ready for use by other users.


### Git Bash
There are some git operation that usually used to manage repository on mobile project, so that the repository is neater. You can see [git bash here](/docs/repository/git-bash).

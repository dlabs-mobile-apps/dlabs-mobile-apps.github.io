# Release Notes

Release notes represent an opportunity to communicate with your customer base. Few companies take advantage of this opportunity. Release notes have become the product-update equivalent of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy statements. They’re written so poorly, with such little regard for the actual human being who must read them, that we’ve all learned to ignore them. 

5 Release Notes Best Practices
1. Use plain language
Leave the techno-jargon out. Write your release notes like you are explaining them to a friend. Preferably one with a degree in history or anthropology, not in computer science.

2. Keep them short
If you’ve added a new integrated calendar into your app that users can access on the main dashboard, great. Just say so. It shouldn’t take more than a sentence or two to explain it. Don’t turn release notes into a novel.

3. Group them logically
If we pop open the release notes accompanying your latest product release, show us immediately—with big, bold category headers—what we’re getting in the new version. Show us FIXES, IMPROVEMENTS, NEW FEATURES, etc. So we can zero in on the areas that interest us most.

4. Include relevant links
If you’ve got a new feature, your release notes should contain a high-level summary of what it can do and where to find it. But, of course, we might want more info, so give us a link to the detailed stuff, like a user guide, step-by-step walk-through, or even a video tutorial.

5. Show your company’s brand and personality
As Sami Linnanvuo suggests, release notes can represent a chance to create engaging content for your community of users and deepen your relationships with customers.

Their article on MindTheProduct, they link to some great release notes from companies like Slack and Trello, who present product updates in engaging ways.

Slack, for example, included this update in the release notes accompanying its version 1.99:
“Fixed: A crash would occur on launch if a highlighted word matched an emoji. This was emojiist and has been remedied.”

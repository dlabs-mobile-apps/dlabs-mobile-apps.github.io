description: Testing is important when developing a product in the form of an application. By implementing testing, we will become more confident when releasing the product or application to the public because we can ensure the application that we developed runs as expected and has fewer bugs.

# Test

There are 3 types of testing methods that are commonly implemented:
## Unit Test
Type of testing on an application where testing is focused on what is called a unit
   
## Widget Test 
Type of testing that is focused on the parts that build the User Interface of an application

## Integration Test 
Type of testing that is focused on testing the entire flow of the application (end-to-end testing)

```bash
echo "coming soon"
```

Splash screen is a screen that loads when you launch an app. When you first open your application, a loading screen, also known as a launch screen or startup screen, appears.

**In short, the splash screen can:**

- Serve as an introduction to the app to set the tone while the entire app loads all the necessary data.
- Helps build brand perception and identity.
- Keeps the user occupied for the time the app executes background tasks.
- It could also show the user loading progress to reduce their anxiety and, therefore, app abandonment.
